			 Thank you for visiting our site. <span>Project Me</span> was created orginally as a mothers and daughters, heart-base
			 interactive workshop. The Universe had bigger plans for this and due to a series of circumstances and events we
			 decided to take the essence of our original workshop content recreate it into a published interactive
			 workbook.Our program engages teenage girls, their mums and women in general to love who they are and to 
			 appreciate their differences.
